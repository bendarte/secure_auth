# Project Enhancement & Security Requirements

This document outlines the planned security improvements and UI enhancements for the project. These changes aim to harden the application against common web attacks and provide a clear, user-friendly interface to monitor our security progress and system requirements.

---

## 1. Security Improvements

### 1.1. Token Management
- **HTTP‑Only Cookies:**  
  *Store JWT tokens exclusively in HTTP‑only cookies instead of in local storage to prevent XSS-based token theft.*
  
- **Refresh Tokens:**  
  *Implement a refresh token mechanism to renew access tokens seamlessly. Create a `/auth/refresh` endpoint that validates a refresh token (stored as an HTTP‑only cookie) and issues a new access token.*

### 1.2. CSRF Protection
- **Use CSRF Middleware:**  
  *Install and integrate middleware such as `csurf` to protect endpoints from Cross-Site Request Forgery.*
- **Expose CSRF Token When Needed:**  
  *Provide an endpoint (e.g., `/csrf-token`) to make the CSRF token available to the front-end if necessary, ensuring secure transfers.*

### 1.3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Express Validator or Joi:**  
  *Integrate libraries like `express-validator` or `Joi` to enforce strict validation rules on inputs (e.g., email format, password length) to mitigate injection and malformed data risks.*

### 1.4. HTTP Security Headers
- **Helmet Configuration:**  
  *Strengthen HTTP headers using Helmet. Explicitly configure content security policies (CSP) to prevent data injection and XSS.*

  ```javascript
  // Example Helmet configuration for Content Security Policy (CSP)
  app.use(
    helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
      directives: {
        defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
        scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
        styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
        imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:"],
        connectSrc: ["'self'"],
        fontSrc: ["'self'"],
        objectSrc: ["'none'"],
        upgradeInsecureRequests: [],
      },
    })
  );
  ```

### 1.5. Endpoint Hardening
- **Rate Limiting:**  
  *Apply stricter rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (like `/auth/login`) to protect against brute-force attempts.*

  ```javascript
  // Example rate limiter on the /auth/login endpoint
  const authLimiter = rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 10, // 10 login attempts per IP per windowMs
    message: "Too many login attempts, please try again later.",
  });
  
  app.use("/auth/login", authLimiter);
  ```

- **Secure Logout:**  
  *Implement a logout endpoint that clears authentication cookies (both access and refresh tokens).*

  ```javascript
  router.post("/logout", (req, res) => {
    res.clearCookie("token");
    res.clearCookie("refreshToken"); // if using refresh tokens
    res.json({ message: "Logged out successfully!" });
  });
  ```

### 1.6. Enforce HTTPS
- **Transport Security:**  
  *Ensure that all communications in production are transmitted over HTTPS. Configure your reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) with valid certificates so the `secure` cookie flag is effective.*

### 1.7. Dependency Management & Audits
- **Regular Audits:**  
  *Run `npm audit` regularly to check for vulnerabilities and update dependencies as needed.*
  
- **Automated CI/CD Security Testing:**  
  *Integrate automated security checks into your CI/CD pipelines to catch issues early.*

### 1.8. Logging & Monitoring
- **Structured Logging:**  
  *Utilize logging libraries like Winston or Bunyan for structured logs. Ensure sensitive data (tokens, passwords) are never logged.*
  
- **Anomaly Detection:**  
  *Monitor logs for repeated failed logins or other anomalies that might indicate an attack.*

## 2. Front-End Enhancements

### 2.1. Clean Requirements Dashboard
Develop a dashboard interface that clearly displays the progress and statuses of all security enhancements. Consider the following design ideas:

- **Modern Framework & Tailwind CSS:**  
  *Build the front-end using a modern framework like React combined with Tailwind CSS to create a responsive, clean, and efficient design.*

- **Requirements Overview Page:**  
  *Create a dedicated page (or section) in your front-end that:*
  - Lists each security requirement in a card or table format.
  - Provides a short description, benefits, and the current implementation status (e.g., "Not Started", "In Progress", "Completed").
  - Uses visual indicators like progress bars, icons, or color coding to denote status.

- **Navigation & Filtering:**  
  *Add navigation controls to filter or search for specific requirements, making it easier to monitor progress over time.*

#### Example Component Structure (Conceptual)
- **RequirementsDashboard.js**  
  This component fetches or statically displays the list of security requirements and renders each as a card.
  
  ```jsx
  // Example: server-frontend/src/components/RequirementsDashboard.js
  import React from "react";
  
  const requirements = [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: "HTTP-Only Cookies for JWT",
      description:
        "Store JWT exclusively in HTTP-only cookies to reduce XSS risks.",
      status: "Completed"
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: "Implement Refresh Tokens",
      description:
        "Implement a secure /auth/refresh endpoint to allow seamless token renewal.",
      status: "In Progress"
    },
    // ... add other requirements following the same structure
  ];
  
  const RequirementsDashboard = () => {
    return (
      <div className="container mx-auto p-4">
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
          Security & Enhancement Dashboard
        </h1>
        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
          {requirements.map((req) => (
            <div
              key={req.id}
              className="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md border border-gray-200"
            >
              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">{req.title}</h2>
              <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">{req.description}</p>
              <span
                className={`inline-block mt-4 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-medium ${
                  req.status.toLowerCase() === "completed"
                    ? "bg-green-500 text-white"
                    : req.status.toLowerCase() === "in progress"
                    ? "bg-orange-500 text-white"
                    : "bg-red-500 text-white"
                }`}
              >
                {req.status}
              </span>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  };
  
  export default RequirementsDashboard;
  ```

- **Tailwind CSS Setup:**  
  *Ensure you have Tailwind CSS set up in your React project. Follow the [official Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) to integrate it properly into your React application.*

### 2.2. API Integration Adjustments
- **Token Handling:**  
  *Ensure that the front-end makes API calls without storing tokens in local storage. Instead, rely on cookies for session management. Adjust fetch configurations and CORS settings appropriately.*

- **Error & Security Alerts:**  
  *Display user-friendly error messages for authentication failures and include visual cues on the dashboard for security events if they occur.*

---

## 3. Implementation Guidelines

### Backend Changes
- Update the JWT creation logic to set tokens only in HTTP-only cookies.
- Implement the `/auth/refresh` endpoint for handling refresh tokens.
- Integrate the `csurf` middleware for CSRF protection.
- Apply `express-validator` in endpoints like `/auth/login` and `/auth/register`.
- Configure Helmet with CSP and other security headers.
- Apply specific rate limiters on sensitive endpoints.

### Frontend Changes
- Remove any logic that stores tokens in local storage.
- Create a dedicated **Requirements Dashboard** component (e.g., `RequirementsDashboard.js`) using React and Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design.
- Ensure fetch requests support HTTP-only cookies for authentication.
- Maintain a clean and modern UI applying component-based and utility-first design principles.

By following the requirements outlined above, you will:
- Strengthen the security posture of the back-end by addressing token management, CSRF, input validation, rate limiting, and secure communications.
- Provide a clear and engaging front-end interface that displays security requirements and progress, aiding in project management and transparency.
- Establish best practices that align with modern web security standards, helping you grow your skills in web security and development.

This document serves as a blueprint for both technical improvements and UI enhancements. Use it as a guide to build out safer, more robust features and a streamlined front-end design that leverages React and Tailwind CSS.
